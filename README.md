This game is more like a minesweeper game . It is developed by KAYKOBAD HOSSAIN TANJIL &  MD SHAHARIAT HOSSAIN .
Here,The game is  programmed in C++ with SFML.

Basically, it is a logic puzzle game of a single player.
The main target of this game is safely digging the mines and detecting bombs hidden randomly under the squares.
A player will get help from clues about the number of bombs in each field's neighboring mines.
During the game, the player uses information given from the opened cells to deduce further cells that are safe to open, iteratively gaining more information to solve the board.


## how to play:
-> Grids are in three states: uncovered, covered and flagged.

-> A covered field is blank and clickable, while an uncovered field is exposed.

-> Flagged fields indicate a potential mine location.

-> A left click uncovers a field. If you uncover a mined field, the game ends.

->A right click on the mouse flagged the square. 

-> To win the game, you must uncover all non-mine squares using the clues.
